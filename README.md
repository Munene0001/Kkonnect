                                       ### Development Commands

                                       ```bash
                                       # Run tests with coverage
                                       make test

                                       # Run code linting
                                       make lint

                                       # Check for security vulnerabilities
                                       make security-check

                                       # Update dependencies
                                       make update-deps

                                       # Run the documentation server
                                       make docs

                                       # Create environment backup
                                       make backup

                                       # Verify environment setup
                                       make verify
                                       ```

                                       ## Testing

                                       The project uses pytest for unit testing and hypothesis for property-based testing:

                                       ```bash
                                       # Run the test suite
                                       make test

                                       # Run with performance benchmarks
                                       pytest tests/ --benchmark-autosave
                                       ```

                                       ## Documentation

                                       Documentation is built using MkDocs with the Material theme:

                                       ```bash
                                       # Serve documentation locally
                                       make docs
                                       ```

                                       ## Containerization

                                       Development environment is containerized with Docker:

                                       ```bash
                                       # Build the development image
                                       make build

                                       # Run the container
                                       make run
                                       ```
